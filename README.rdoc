# Pokedex in Rails with some kind of front-end Javascript framework TBD...

I am playing around with building an API in Rails that will interact with a front-end framework like Angular or BackboneJS.

Controller tests generated from command line; integration tests and model tests written to test-drive the back-end.

In this project, users can catalog their Pokemon adventures by recording the Pokemon they caught or encountered into their Pokedex.
